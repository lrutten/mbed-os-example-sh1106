# Test OLED SH1106 display on Nucleo-F446RE board

This test uses the adapted Adafruit graphic library for SH1106 driver lcds.
This library was originally made for SSD1306 and is adapted for SH1106 displays.
some small oled lcd use SH1106 driver.

The SH1106 driver doesn't provide several functions such as scroll commands.
